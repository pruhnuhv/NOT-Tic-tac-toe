This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Vanilla Js. As a foolish challenge, I was told to complicate the code as much as possible and in the process learn more about things I wouldn't use in everyday code or things I would've overlooked while working with a framework. Also, I Haven't focused much on the css bits of it. This tic-tac-toe features the normal game, with additional options to undo the last move and restart the game on finishing.
